/**
 * This file should only include @include declarations
 *
 * It is organized into a specific order that is worth adhereing to
 *
 * 1. Variables are defined first so everything can use them
 * 2. Third party utils are included next so that can also be leveraged
 * 3. Custom utils come after that, add anything that will help you be more consistent
 *    and help you from repeting yourself
 * 4. Normalize and global styles come next to form a base layer of styling
 * 5. Components come next.  If you are going to be reusing a style for a button add those
 *    styles to a component file
 * 6. Lastly page files.  These are included last so they can override things on a per
 *    page basis.
 *
 * Other Styling Notes:
 * - It is not a strict rule, but try and adhere to the Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming
 *   convention. See: https://en.bem.info/method/key-concepts/
 *
 * - Along the same lines you should try and avoid defining deeply nested styles that are
 *   built on a lot of decendent selectors.  Not only are they more expensive for the browser
 *   but they make your code difficult to debug and change.  Try and limit yourself to one level
 *   of inheritance.
